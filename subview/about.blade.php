<body>

    <h1><center> e-Book Exchange is an online app platform for sharing books.</center></h1>

    <p><center>This app allows you to share books online with readers you don’t necessarily know. <br>
    <br>Our motive is to boost the habit of reading and spread the 
    word for all to enter the magical world of books, <br>
    <br>As books force you to slow down and see 
    the world through the eyes of your mind. <br>
    <br><br>So, lose yourselves in books app,
     because that’s where you will find yourself too!</center></p>
